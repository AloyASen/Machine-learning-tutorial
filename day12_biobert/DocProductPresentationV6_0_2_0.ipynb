I\\u2019ve had a CT scan which came back normal, I\\u2019ve been on amitriptyline, topamax, and propranolol to try to prevent the migraines and I\\u2019ve used maxalt and sumatriptan to break migraines at onset. I haven\\u2019t had consistent relief with any medication, the 3 prophylactics only helped a few of my symptoms and the maxalt/ sumatriptan only succeeded in breaking my migraines about 25% of the time.  I just want to know if anyone can help me figure out what is wrong with me. I\\u2019ll list my symptoms below.  -Sharp shooting pain shooting down jawline from mandibular joint and across cheekbones. Usually on only one side of my face but it changes sides randomly.  -Extreme pain in eyes, sensitivity to light and movement. See flashes of light even when eyes are closed.  -sharp pain starting at base of head/top of neck that runs up head and causes pain in eyes.  -Sharp pain in ears usually accompanied by ringing  Dizziness and nausea, occasionally vomiting  Muscle spasms, usually in hands or face  All pain worsens with any change in position; standing, sitting, rolling over while lying down.  Usually I\\u2019ll know that I\\u2019m going to get a migraine because it starts with the shooting face pain or the eye pain. The 3 prophylactics helped the facial pain but didn\\u2019t reduce the number of migraines I had per month and they all gave me pretty bad side effects.  Side effects from medication  Topamax: felt drunk, nauseous, twitchy  Amitriptyline: extreme fatigue even into the next day when taken at night, confusion, balance issues, muscle spasms  Propranolol: nausea, hair loss, fatigue\"  #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",
